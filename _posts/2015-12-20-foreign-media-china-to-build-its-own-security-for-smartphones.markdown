![Alt Foreign Media: China to build its own security for smartphones](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/730/23779153561_fd8d5625b3_b.jpg)　　On November 20, according to foreign media reports, China is trying to make security smart phone, so these devices from the United States monitor.[![Alt iPhone 6 leather case](http://www.purcase.com/image/cache/catalog/i6c/leather_case_i6001_1-600x600.jpg)](http://www.purcase.com/rainbow-iphone-6-genuine-leather-case-yellow-green-p50c59.html)　　State-owned enterprises and some tech-savvy Chinese firms are involved in the scheme. That is creating a localization technology industry Beijing, from United States suppliers the latest attempt.　　A long time, Chinese officials for United States companies in the smart-phone operating systems and processors dominate the field situation irritated--operating system and processor is most likely to be attacked in the phone section. China has the world\'s largest smartphone market, but nearly all devices from Apple and Android launched by Google. [leather iPhone 6 cases](http://burberry2015.blog.com/2015/08/14/samsung-released-the-largest-capacity-in-the-history-16tb-ssd-hard-drive-prices-can-only)　　Technology means no achievements for China on this issue for many years.　　Today, a large number of Chinese technology companies are getting rid of Western technology has made progress on. In 2013, \"prisms\" stimulus, Chinese official encourages such efforts. \"Prism\" refers to United States National Security Council before snow disclosed contract employees, the National Security Council in a number of overseas United States implanting surveillance equipment \"back door\" events.　　Smart phone maker ZTE, China is developing a security smart phone for government agencies. A spokesman for the company said the device uses self developed operating system, processor chip from Chinese suppliers. China\'s largest chip company Spreadtrum Communications, mass production of a domestic operating system running by the end of the company\'s chips.　　E-commerce company Alibaba has been cooperation with the Chinese Ministry of public security, police officers develop a mobile operating system, in which payments more secure.　　All these efforts are aimed at government agencies and State-owned enterprise group of specific customers, are unlikely to attract consumers. In ZTE\'s safety cell phone, for example, the device has no camera, no GPS, no WiFi and Bluetooth in order to minimize security risks.　　This trend is unlikely to affect the United States mobile phone components and software in China\'s market share. Market research firm IDC analysts expect next year, secure mobile phones in China has the largest share of smartphone sales accounted for 3%, which is about 2 million. However, if more of its own operating system and processor into consumer devices, it may pose a challenge to Google\'s Android and Qualcomm.　　According to another analyst firm Strategy Analytics and statistics, Qualcomm processor in 52% per cent share of the Smartphone market last year. The company declined to comment on the report. IDC statistics shows that Google Android in this year\'s second-quarter share of the global Smartphone 82.8%. Google did not immediately comment on the matter.　　Other United States technology companies have also felt the chill from China. As the Government agencies and State-owned enterprises to buy more tide products, Huawei and other local companies, such as IBM, Cisco, United States network device or computing equipment maker\'s revenue has fallen. [iPhone 6 leather case](http://www.purcase.com/rainbow-iphone-6-genuine-leather-case-yellow-green-p50c59.html)　　Cisco does not disclose specific sales data for countries, but said snow events affecting the sales of products in China. IBM will fall due to the slowdown in China\'s economic growth. Two companies were not placed in their own technical \"back door\".　　Bank of China began to purchase more local brands of smartphones, but because of United States pressure, the official programme was suspended early this year. The Wall Street Journal saw a copy of the provisions that were discontinued, said half of the Chinese wanted to require financial institutions to purchase new machines meet the \"security control\" standard.　　Promoted to create domestic safety device there are also economic benefits: that is essential for safety components are also some of the most profitable components. However, even with a Chinese-made the processor, operating system and modem, mobile phone here in China is likely to contain a large number of external components, but this component is not as sensitive on the issue.　　ZTE spokesman Smartphone not only Chinese-developed hardware and software, but in order to meet the needs of government agencies, and companies are trying to use local suppliers as much as possible.　　Includes cool, qihoo 360, China\'s other mobile phone manufacturers also want to have a share in this market. The publicity in this year, the company launched new products such as data encryption and other security features.　　Spreadtrum Li Liyou, Chief Executive, said his company on sale this year will be special chipset allows users on Android and China Science and technology company (Yuanxin) developed an encryption switching between operating systems. \"Encrypted voice, can encrypt data, very safe,\" he said.　　However, network security firm FireEye\'s Chief Technology Officer, bulaisi·Bolan (Bryce Boland), relying only on internal components of the local production does not mean that security is guaranteed. He said, hackers can steal data directly from the telecom operators, and new vulnerabilities of the operating system may be much higher.　　To provide government agencies with security smartphones more than China. United States National Security Council during 2009 has developed a local version of the phone, but it this year and switch to a system based on Samsung smartphones, supplemented by customized security software. United States developed by the NSA phone \"when real launch, already behind in technology\", information assurance Director, National Security Directorate daibola·pulanjite (Debora Plunkett) in 2012, said in an interview.　　Old China Mobile Alliance Secretary-General Yao said some Western Governments, and Canada the BlackBerry company, high security phone tailored for officials, Chinese and Western companies trust each other enough, so this cannot be achieved. \"China has no choice, can only develop their own operating system to guarantee security,\" he said.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: mobile phone
