February 3, Beijing time, according to a study by the University of Leicester in England, due to the effects of human activity, by mid-century, the Earth\'s oceans and land sediments there will be a lot of plastic waste.　　The study, published in the human world (Anthropocene) journal. Scientists have suggested that because human beings on the planet is very extensive and unprecedented change, in terms of geology, the Earth has entered a new era--Anthropocene. Mankind has entered the study examine the evidence of the human world, and the Earth\'s surface because of persistent a significant change in the mass production of synthetic plastics, we entered a \"plastic age\".　　Jan Zalasiewicz, a paleontologist of the Department of geology, University of Leicester explained: \"at the time of our grandparents were kids, they know nothing about plastics. But now, plastics have become an indispensable part of our lives. They are everywhere, used to wrap food, as a container for water and milk, provided they are eggs, yogurt and chocolate boxes, and sterile drugs saved. Most of the clothes we wear are made of plastic. ” [FENDI plus case](http://www.nixcase.com/fendi-karlito-iphone-6-plus-case-black-p-5234.html)　　\"Plastic can be said everywhere on Earth, from the top of the mountain to the deep seabed and save these plastics can become fossils to far into the future. Every three years we will be able to produce nearly 1 billion tons of plastic. If the past few decades all plastics are made into food films, enough to cover the whole world. In accordance with current trends in production, the century, humans into food if the total production of plastic films, can be covered with several layers of the Earth. ”　　The study also showed that plastic will be long-term, lasting impact on the geology of the Earth, because they are very stable, very difficult to degrade. Therefore, when plastic garbage scattered on the ground, will become part of the soil, and eventually was washed to the sea. Plankton, fish, sea birds and other marine animals are likely to die because ingestion of plastic waste. Plastic garbage in the oceans for thousands of kilometers, and many will gather at \"Ocean garbage patch\", or eventually be washed on a remote beach. Plastic may sink to the seabed, became part of the formation of the future.　　From the mid 20th century, plastics are widely used. On one hand, plastic material element is important to modern life, on the other hand has become a serious problem of environmental pollution, the scientific community has done a lot of research. From the distribution of land and sea, geology of plastics has become a key indicator, is the formation of unique components.　　\"The next 1000 years, as temporary storage--landfill-and gradually eroded, plastic will last into the cycle of sediments. We can distinguish between different types of plastics and products--known as \' technological fossils \', to fine sediments of human time. Plastic will be buried into the ground, and many also have potential for long-term preservation of, \"Professor Zalasiewicz added,\" once was buried due to durable stability, plastic is quite likely to become fossils millions of years which indicate some kind of super convenient material evidence. Plastic era may last for quite a long time. ”　　Dr Matt Edgeworth in the study, said: \"see plastics as anthropology and the study of geology may seem strange, because they are so new, but we found more and more recent formation of plastic containment. Formation of plastics can serve as a very good marks. ”　　In 2016, led by Professor Jan Zalasiewicz \"Anthropocene working group\" will gather more evidence about the Anthropocene, helped this new unit was officially established, and the definition and explanation. Study co-author Colin Waters added: \"we have become accustomed to living in between the plastic, but it is \' invisible \' plastic particles--from cosmetics and toothpaste, as well as our clothing fibers-accumulating at the bottom of oceans and lakes, perhaps this will become a very important legacy in the geological record. ” [Fendi](https://medium.com/@vanscase/microsoft-pushes-education-minecraft-teachers-9fd4f36c4b6b#.j1bnnplcr) [http://www.nixcase.com/images/large/i6plus/fendi_i6p2223_lrg.jpg](http://www.nixcase.com/images/large/i6plus/fendi_i6p2223_lrg.jpg) [Article correction][![Alt FENDI plus case]([[1, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h060/h92/img201602031232510.jpg\', \'The Earth has been \"plastic planet\": stable and refractory\', \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1562/24673353212_286c4aefd3_z.jpg\']])](http://www.nixcase.com/fendi-karlito-iphone-6-plus-case-black-p-5234.html)Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: outdoor
