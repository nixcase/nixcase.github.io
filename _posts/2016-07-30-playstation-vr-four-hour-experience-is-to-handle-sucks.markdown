Although PlayStation VR evaluation is not the first time we saw it, but now that Sony have disclosed the price and details, indicates that the device is finalized, we can enjoy it.　　Sony PlayStation VR position very clearly, it is cheap. Therefore, it was selected for the VR Head not high prices, and specialized processing units to help players get more fluid experience. Coupled with this year\'s line-up is finally open, it\'s worth to look at. GDC-game developers Conference, we take a look at experience PlayStation VR in a row after a four-hour experience:![Alt PlayStation VR four-hour experience is to handle sucks](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8622/28028063844_0395915a9e_b.jpg)　　Experience four-hour PlayStation VR, played after starting the game, we can say that it has to find its own position. Head of good ergonomic design, both put on, take off or adjust the location very easy. Even wearing glasses, you can find the best way to wear and not too tight.

Sony and the developers a lot of efforts on art, game hardware restrictions as possible within the scope of the feast for the eyes.　　Perhaps the biggest problem in Yu Suoni PlayStation MOVE handle. Design of the PlayStation MOVE, bluntly said that the Wii and belongs to the same era, and a far cry from today\'s standards. If Sony sticks to this design, it was a huge mistake, hope the device before actual sale it can only get better.[![Alt Cath Kidston iPhone 6](http://www.awacase.com/images/large/i6/cath_kidston_i6100_lrg.jpg)](http://www.awacase.com/peony-cath-kidston-iphone-6-case-p-3953.html)![Alt PlayStation VR four-hour experience is to handle sucks](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8592/28566643541_9f084364f1_b.jpg)　　PlayStation a Demo called the Golem on the VR is very interesting, it tells the story of a little girl, legs, telepathic control of small dolls, as well as the giant golem. When you become a Golem, and use the handle to fight became a major play. You need to use your hands to attack or defend.　　But here\'s the thing: PlayStation MOVE response slow, track position is not accurate, the most deadly is it is not velocity sensitive, makes a quick blow may turn in slow motion.　　Another example is the Job of the Simulator. This Demo you can also experience in the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, however the PlayStation VR was in big trouble. Because the PlayStation MOVE relatively slow, grab the thing became a boring thing.![Alt PlayStation VR four-hour experience is to handle sucks](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7695/28360839000_4f8a5e271d_b.jpg)　　PlayStation MOVE in design also has a problem. Oculus Rift and HTC Vive handle will make you feel like you are in the virtual world, but PlayStation MOVE too big and thick, the most intuitive sense that I myself have been holding two sticks, which was dropped significantly by immersion.　　PlayStation VR experience will provide the best two games on the Rez is unlimited and the EVE: Valkyrie. The irony is, was named best in part because they do not rely on the PlayStation MOVE, but the PS4 handles.![Alt PlayStation VR four-hour experience is to handle sucks](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8833/28360844840_5782b9cecd_b.jpg)　　We do not expect Sony to in the next six or seven months, completely change the design of the PlayStation MOVE, hoping that better in performance.　　General comments　　There is no doubt that PlayStation is a good VR VR head. It specifically for PS4 platform to build, let us tangled computer configuration is required, just buy a PS4, PlayStation can start VR virtual reality tour. Sony has made it clear that PlayStation VR\'s biggest advantages is the low threshold, the positioning of their products is very clear. [Cath Kidston iPhone 6](http://www.awacase.com/peony-cath-kidston-iphone-6-case-p-3953.html)　　However, the PlayStation MOVE PlayStation VR experience of bad quality compromised. Perhaps because of cost considerations, this handle is relatively backward in design, but also not so top-notch technology. This new controller intended to replace our hands, if not exact, is meaningless.[Article correction]Favorites Favorites 1542Tags:PC and hardware\r Science and technology GameIf you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
